# NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset
CMAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation). It is a system developed by NASA to study engine degradation. It is coded in MATLAB and Simulink (A toolbox of MATLAB). The engine under study is a turbofan engine (a jet engine). A turbofan engine has many components. A few important components are: Fan, Low Pressure Compressor (LPC), High Pressure Compressor (HPC), Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), High Pressure Turbine (HPT). During operation, degradation occurs in each of the components. If degradation level in any component exceeds a threshold, the engine is said to have failed.
The dataset is available on NASA Prognostics Data Repository [link](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/).
